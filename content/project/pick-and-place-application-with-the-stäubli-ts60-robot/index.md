T﻿his project was aimed at developing a robotics solution for effective package classification and palletizing in an industrial setting. The four-degree-of-freedom SCARA TS60 robot fitted with a vacuum end-effector was chosen as the industrial arm for this application. 

I﻿n the application pipeline, packages are dispensed automatically before they are classified according to their material type (metals or plastics). Following the classification, the packages are picked by the TS60 arm and placed in the right pallets based on their material types. 

T﻿he full solution was developed using the SRS Stäubli suite and sufficiently tested in simulation before deploying on the hardware. 

T﻿his project was completed as part of a series of laboratory sections in the robotics lab at the University of Girona.
