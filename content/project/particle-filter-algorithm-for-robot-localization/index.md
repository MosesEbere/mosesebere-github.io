This project involved designing a recursive Particle Filter-based state estimation algorithm to manage a particle set representing potential robot states, enhancing the localization accuracy significantly. 

T﻿he algorithm incorporates prediction, weighting, and resampling steps to effectively localize a robot within a predefined map.
