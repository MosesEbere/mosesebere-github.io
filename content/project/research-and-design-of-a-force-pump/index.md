This project involved designing a force pump in CATIA v5 given limited information on its specifications. More specifically, the tasks involved selecting suitable materials for each part, creating an assembly of all parts, researching and including GDT (Geometrical Dimensioning and Tolerancing) data, and drafting standard working drawings for all the parts included with (a bill of materials).

T﻿his project was carried out in partial fulfillment of the credit requirements of the Software Applications in Mechanical Engineering Junior Year course at Cukurova University.
