T﻿his project was aimed at developing a robotics solution for effective parts assembly and palletizing in an industrial setting. The six-degree-of-freedom TX60 robot fitted with a gripper end-effector was chosen as the industrial arm for this application. 

I﻿n the application pipeline, peripheral parts are dispensed automatically before they are picked using the gripper of the robotic arm. These parts are placed in an assembly station and other parts are obtained from designated pallets and assembled in the assembly station. Once the assembly process is completed, the final product by the arm and placed in the right pallets. 

T﻿he full solution was developed using the SRS Stäubli suite and sufficiently tested in simulation before deploying on the hardware. 

T﻿his project was completed as part of a series of laboratory sections in the robotics lab at the University of Girona.
